## Namaste React Course by Akshay Saini

# _Episode 01 - Inception_

## Theory :

- What is `Emmet`?
// you can use short expressions to generate HTML markup, CSS.

- What is `CDN`? Why do we `use` it?
// network of servers that are spread out across the world to speed up the delivery of web content, reduces page load times and improves the user experience.

- Why is `React known as React`?
// It "reacts" quickly to changes without reloading the whole page. It uses the virtual DOM to efficiently update parts of a webpage.

- What is `crossorigin in script tag`?
// controls how the script element handles cross-origin requests (CORS). HTTP feature that allows web applications to access resources from other domains.

- What is difference between `React and ReactDOM`?
// React is like the architect who designs how things should look, and ReactDOM is the construction worker who puts those designs   into action on a website.
// Whenever we use component, classes, elements, etc. We’re using React and whenever we use methods like render() or findDOMNode() we’re using React-DOM.

- What is difference between `react.development.js` and `react.production.js` files via CDN?
// development -> extra warnings about common mistakes
// production -> extra performance optimizations & strip all error messages; minified version, no warnings
