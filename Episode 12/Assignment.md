## Theory Assignment:

- Advantages of using Redux Toolkit over Redux
  // Redux Toolkit (RTK) is an official, recommended toolset for efficient Redux development. It addresses many common concerns with Redux and provides a more streamlined approach to state management. Here are some advantages of using Redux Toolkit over traditional Redux:

1. Simplified Setup
   Pre-configured Store: RTK includes configureStore, which sets up the store with good defaults, including Redux DevTools integration and middleware like redux-thunk.
   Less Boilerplate: RTK reduces the amount of boilerplate code needed to set up Redux, making it easier to get started.
2. Immutable Updates
   Immer Integration: RTK uses Immer to handle immutable updates, allowing you to write more concise and readable update logic. You can write "mutative" code, and Immer ensures that the updates are applied immutably.
3. Code Organization
   Slices: RTK introduces the concept of slices, which allow you to define the reducer, actions, and state for a particular feature in one place. This promotes better code organization and modularity.
4. Best Practices Included
   Standardized Patterns: RTK encourages the use of standardized patterns and best practices. This includes using slices, action creators, and thunks, reducing the variability and potential errors in Redux code.
5. Better Developer Experience
   Redux DevTools: RTKâ€™s pre-configured store setup ensures easy integration with Redux DevTools, providing a powerful debugging experience.
   Auto-generated Action Creators and Types: RTK automatically generates action creators and action types, reducing the need for manual definitions and reducing the risk of errors.
6. Asynchronous Logic
   createAsyncThunk: RTK simplifies asynchronous logic with createAsyncThunk, a powerful utility that handles common patterns for dispatching actions before, during, and after an async request.
7. Middleware
   Included Middleware: RTK includes commonly used middleware like redux-thunk by default, saving you from setting it up manually.
8. Enhanced TypeScript Support
   TypeScript Integration: RTK provides strong TypeScript support, including pre-configured types for actions, reducers, and slices, making it easier to work with TypeScript and Redux together.
9. Community and Ecosystem
   Official Tool: RTK is officially recommended by the Redux team, ensuring ongoing support and updates. It also has a growing ecosystem of tools and extensions designed to work seamlessly with it.
   By adopting Redux Toolkit, developers can leverage these advantages to create more maintainable, scalable, and efficient state management solutions in their applications.

- Explain Dispatcher.
  // The dispatch function is used to send actions to the store. When an action is dispatched, the store's reducer processes the action and updates the state accordingly.

- Explain Reducer.
  // Reducers are pure functions that take the current state and an action as arguments and return a new state. They specify how the state should change in response to an action.

- Explain Slice.
  // slice is a collection of Redux reducer logic and actions for a specific feature of your application. Slices help organize and modularize your Redux code, making it more maintainable and easier to manage. Each slice contains the state, reducers, and actions related to a specific part of your application.

- Explain Selector.
  // Selectors are functions that extract specific pieces of state from the store, making it easier to retrieve and use the data in your components.

- Explain createSlice and the configuration it takes.
  import { createSlice } from '@reduxjs/toolkit';

// Define the initial state of the slice
const initialState = {
value: 0,
};

// Create a slice
const counterSlice = createSlice({
name: 'counter',
initialState,
reducers: {
increment: (state) => {
state.value += 1;
},
decrement: (state) => {
state.value -= 1;
},
incrementByAmount: (state, action) => {
state.value += action.payload;
},
},
});

// Export the actions generated by the slice
export const { increment, decrement, incrementByAmount } = counterSlice.actions;

// Export the reducer to be used in the store
export default counterSlice.reducer;

import { configureStore } from '@reduxjs/toolkit';
import counterReducer from './counterSlice';

const store = configureStore({
reducer: {
counter: counterReducer,
},
});

export default store;
